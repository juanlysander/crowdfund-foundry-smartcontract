This repository contains a Solidity smart contract project focused on implementing a crowdfunding platform. The project was inspired by lessons taught by Patrick Collins, an expert in Solidity development and blockchain technologies.

## Introduction
The Solidity Crowdfunding Project aims to create a decentralized platform for crowdfunding campaigns. The project is built using the Solidity programming language, which is widely used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, the project enables transparent, secure, and efficient crowdfunding processes.

## Features
